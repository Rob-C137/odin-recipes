    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate--and I didn't even separate the eggs and whip the whites. Also, I used water instead of milk--and I liked them better that way. I like to serve these with a pat of butter, a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup. </p>
   
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds pork spareribs</li>
        <li>2 (18 ounce) bottls barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place spareribs in a large stock pot with barbeque sauce, onion, salt, and pepper. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a low boil, and cook approximately 40 minutes.</li>
