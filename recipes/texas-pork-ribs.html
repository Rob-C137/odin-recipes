    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a multiple prize-winning master recipe. It has several steps that can be used on pork spareribs, country-style ribs, or pretty much any other type of pork rib; simply adjust oven time up for meatier cuts. Use some soaked wood chips on the barbecue. The smokier the grill, the better the ribs will taste! </p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 pounds pork spareribs </li>
        <li>1½ cups white sugar </li>
        <li>¼ cup salt</li>
        <li>2½ tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sweet paprika </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons pan drippings</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>4 cups ketchup</li>
        <li>3 cups hot water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup wood chips, soaked</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</li>
        <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</li>
    </ol>
